# Honeycomb Starter Packs

Starter packs are intended to streamline the implementation of various day 1 and 2 features. These packs act as a foundation from which one can expand upon and customize to their specific needs. 

Each starter pack includes:
- README.md
  - Prerequisites
  - Installation instructions
  - An embedded video
  - An explanation of the saved queries and why they're useful
- `terraform` folder
  - Terraform code necessary for function
  - Resources for Boards, Saved Queries, Triggers, etc
